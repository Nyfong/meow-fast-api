#Purpose of Pydantic Models:

Pydantic models, built upon BaseModel, are used for:
Data Validation: They enforce type hints and other constraints (e.g., minimum length for strings, range for numbers) on data, ensuring that incoming data conforms to a defined structure and rules.
Data Parsing: They can automatically parse raw data (e.g., from JSON, dictionaries) into structured Python objects with the correct types.
Serialization: They can easily convert Python objects back into various formats, such as JSON or dictionaries.
Documentation (especially with FastAPI): When used with frameworks like FastAPI, Pydantic models automatically generate interactive API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger UI), clearly outlining the expected request and response structures.
